The steps for deploying the DEV501 app from your training Org to a Development Edition (DE) Org are below.  
	
I.	Make Manual Additions to the DE Org
	1. 	In the DE Org, manually create two Custom Objects:
		a.	Position (Record Name = Title, Data Type = Text, Enable Reports, Activities, Field History Tracking and Notes and Attachments)
		b.	Candidate (Record Name = Candidate Number, Data Type = Auto Number, Display Format = C-{0000}, Enable Reports, Activities, Field History Tracking and Notes and Attachments)
	2. 	In the DE Org, manually create a Queue (Queue Name = Recruiter Queue, Selected Objects = Position and Candidate). Can be found under Manage Users - Queues.
	3. 	In the DE Org, manually add the Social Security Number field to the Candidate Object (Data Type = Text, Field Label = Social Security Number, Length = 12) - note: DE Orgs do not support encryption
	4. 	In the DE Org, manually change Org Wide Defaults (OWD) Sharing for Position & Candidate Objects to Private from Public Read/Write. Can be found under Security Controls->Sharing Settings.

II. Make edits in the Force.com Project
	5. 	If you have not already, create a Force.com project connected to your Training Org. If already setup, use "Refresh from Server" to update the local copy of your project with the latest from the server.
	6.	Change to "Work Offline" mode. 
	7.	Make changes to the project in Eclipse	
		a.	Remove references in the Training Org Candidate object XML file to the Social Security Number field: <fields><fullName>Social_Security_Number__c</fullName><label>Social Security Number</label><length>12</length><maskChar>X</maskChar><maskType>ssn</maskType><type>EncryptedText</type></fields> 
		b.	Change references in the Training Org Job Application Workflow for the <integrationUser> tag from admin@<YourTrainingDomainHere>.DevOrg to your user account at the DE Org

III.	Deploy Training Project to DE Org via Force.com IDE. When deploying to server, use DE Org login credentials.
	8.	Deploy to Server... Deselect all items, then Check All Custom Objects.
	9.	Deploy to Server... the default selected items, but skip (uncheck) the items below:
    a.	All Custom Apps
    b. 	The Custom Object Idea
		c.	All Custom Tabs
    d.	All Dashboards
    e.	All HomePage Components
    f.	All HomePage Layouts
    g.	The 4 Page Layouts which start with Css*
    h.	All Profiles
	10. 	Deploy to Server... Deselect all items, then Check...
		a.	All Green Custom Applications
		b.	All Green Custom Tabs

IV.	Make final change to DE Org		
	11.	In the DE Org, manually edit the Recruiting and Custom Administration apps - make visible to all Profiles.
	12. Optionally, you can recreate the custom profiles and users to test the application with non-system administrators
